# Quickstart: Docusaurus Documentation Site

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Prerequisites**: Ensure Node.js (v18+) and npm are installed.
2.  **Initialization**: The project will be set up using the Docusaurus command line utility.
    ```bash
    npx create-docusaurus@latest . classic
    ```
    *Note: The actual implementation will perform this step.*

3.  **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project root and install.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Development Workflow

1.  **Start Development Server**: To start the local server with hot reloading:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The site will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

2.  **Build Static Site**: To generate the final static HTML/CSS/JS files for deployment:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    The output will be placed in the `build/` directory.

## Content Structure

All documentation files will reside in the `docs/` directory. The main content will be organized into two top-level categories:

1.  **Modules**: Corresponds to `docs/modules/`
2.  **Weekly Breakdown**: Corresponds to `docs/weekly-breakdown/`

The structure of the navigation is primarily managed via `sidebars.js` and local `_category_.json` files.
