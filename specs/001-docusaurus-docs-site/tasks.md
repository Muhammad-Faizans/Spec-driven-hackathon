# Tasks: Docusaurus Documentation Site

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-docusaurus-docs-site/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: No explicit test tasks were requested in the feature specification. Verification will be performed by successful build.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [X] T001 Create Docusaurus project in root using `npx create-docusaurus@latest . classic`
- [X] T002 Install npm dependencies using `npm install`
- [X] T003 Configure site title ("Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics") and tagline in `docusaurus.config.js`

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core documentation structure that MUST be complete before content ingestion begins

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T004 Create `docs/` subdirectory structure: `docs/modules/`, `docs/weekly-breakdown/`
- [X] T005 Configure skeleton sidebar structure in `sidebars.js` (defining the overall hierarchy of docs).

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - View Educational Content (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Deliver the entire book content as a navigable Docusaurus site.

**Independent Test**: Run `npm run build` and ensure the build succeeds, then run `npm start` and verify all sidebar links are functional and load correct content.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T006 [US1] Create Module 1 content page: `docs/modules/module-1-ros-2.md`
- [X] T007 [US1] Create Module 2 content page: `docs/modules/module-2-digital-twin.md`
- [X] T008 [US1] Create Module 3 content page: `docs/modules/module-3-ai-robot-brain.md`
- [X] T009 [US1] Create Module 4 content page: `docs/modules/module-4-vla.md`
- [X] T010 [US1] Create Weeks 1-2 content page: `docs/weekly-breakdown/weeks-1-2.md`
- [X] T011 [US1] Create Weeks 3-5 content page: `docs/weekly-breakdown/weeks-3-5.md`
- [X] T012 [US1] Create Weeks 6-7 content page: `docs/weekly-breakdown/weeks-6-7.md`
- [X] T013 [US1] Create Weeks 8-10 content page: `docs/weekly-breakdown/weeks-8-10.md`
- [X] T014 [US1] Create Weeks 11-12 content page: `docs/weekly-breakdown/weeks-11-12.md`
- [X] T015 [US1] Create Week 13 content page: `docs/weekly-breakdown/week-13.md`
- [X] T016 [US1] Create Course Overview and Learning Outcomes page: `docs/overview.md`
- [X] T017 [US1] Create Hardware Requirements page: `docs/hardware-requirements.md`
- [X] T018 [US1] Update `sidebars.js` to define the Module and Weekly Breakdown structure, linking all content pages (T006-T017) to match the book outline.

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Final verification and cosmetic touches.

- [X] T019 [P] Copy placeholder logo and favicon to `static/img/`
- [ ] T020 Run final Docusaurus build (`npm run build`) and confirm success.

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories

### Within Each User Story

- Content files (T006-T017) can be created in parallel (marked [P] in a multi-story context, but run sequentially here).
- `sidebars.js` update (T018) MUST run after all content pages are created.

### Parallel Opportunities

- T019 (Copy assets) can be run anytime after Phase 1.

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Content transcription)
4. Complete Phase 4: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns (Final build check)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently.

### Incremental Delivery

The entire task list represents the MVP.

### Parallel Team Strategy

Not applicable for a single-story MVP, but T019 can be done in parallel with content creation.
