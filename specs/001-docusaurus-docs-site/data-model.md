# Data Model: Docusaurus Documentation Site

**Status**: Not Applicable (N/A)

**Rationale**: This project is a Static Site Generator (SSG) for documentation. It does not require a runtime database, persistent data entities, or complex data relationships beyond the hierarchical structure managed by Docusaurus's filesystem and `sidebars.js` configuration.

The "data" of this project consists of Markdown files, which are treated as static assets.

## Key Entities (Configuration/Asset Structure)

- **Markdown File**: Static asset containing content. Mapped to a URL path.
- **Sidebar Category**: Configuration that groups Markdown files into a collapsible list in the navigation.
- **`docusaurus.config.js`**: Primary configuration asset for the site's metadata and plugins.
- **`sidebars.js`**: Core navigation configuration asset that defines the structure of the documentation.
