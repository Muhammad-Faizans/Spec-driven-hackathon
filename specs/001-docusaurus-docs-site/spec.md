# Feature Specification: Docusaurus Documentation Site

**Feature Branch**: `master`  
**Created**: 2025-12-01  
**Status**: Finalized  
**Input**: User description (Physical AI Book Content for Docusaurus Site)

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### User Story 1 - View Educational Content (Priority: P1)

The user (student) can access the Docusaurus site and easily navigate the entire "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" course content, structured by Modules and Weeks.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functional requirement of the project.

**Independent Test**: The site can be fully built and served locally (`npm run serve`) and all links in the sidebar are functional.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the site is loaded, **When** the user clicks a link in the sidebar, **Then** the corresponding content page (e.g., Module 3, Week 8) loads quickly and accurately.
2. **Given** the user is viewing a page, **When** they view code snippets, **Then** the code is correctly syntax-highlighted and readable.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST render all provided book content (Modules, Weeks, Assessments, Hardware) in Docusaurus Markdown files. (Principle I)
- **FR-002**: The system MUST configure the Docusaurus sidebar to reflect the hierarchical structure of the course content (Modules -> Weekly Breakdown). (Principle II)
- **FR-003**: The site MUST build successfully without warnings or errors.
- **FR-004**: The UI MUST use the default Docusaurus theme with minimal overrides. (Principle III)

### Key Entities (include if feature involves data)

- **Documentation Page**: A Docusaurus Markdown file (`.md` or `.mdx`) containing a section of the course content. Key attributes are `title`, `slug`, and `content`.
- **Sidebar Category**: A JSON file (`_category_.json`) that groups related pages, corresponding to a Module or a Weekly section.

## Success Criteria (mandatory)

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: All 4 Modules and all 13 Weeks are present as distinct, navigable pages in the built site.
- **SC-002**: A site build is achievable in under 30 seconds on the target system.
- **SC-003**: The site is fully functional and responsive on standard desktop and mobile viewport sizes. (Principle V)
