# Implementation Plan: Docusaurus Documentation Site

**Branch**: `master` | **Date**: 2025-12-01 | **Spec**: User Input (Physical AI Book Content)

## Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of a static documentation website for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" book using Docusaurus. The primary task is structuring the book's content (Modules 1-4, Weekly Breakdown, Hardware Requirements) into Docusaurus Markdown files and configuring the sidebars to reflect the hierarchical structure outlined in the source material (Constitution Principle II). The final output must be a maintainable, accurate (Principle I), and functional documentation site (Principle V).

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript (Node.js/npm), Docusaurus v3+, Markdown/MDX  
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus, React  
**Storage**: N/A (Static Site Generation - SSG)  
**Testing**: Manual content verification (Docusaurus build, link checking)  
**Target Platform**: Web (Static HTML/CSS/JS)
**Project Type**: Web (Documentation Site)
**Performance Goals**: Fast loading times inherent to SSG.  
**Constraints**: Must use standard Docusaurus components and minimal custom styling to adhere to hackathon scope and Principle III (Simplicity and Maintainability).  
**Scale/Scope**: ~10 documentation pages (Modules, Weeks, Assessments, Hardware).

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] **I. Content Fidelity**: Does the plan ensure the technical implementation will accurately represent the source educational material? **Yes, by transcribing content verbatim into Markdown/MDX.**
- [x] **II. Structure Follows Content**: Does the proposed structure map logically to the book's outline (Modules, Weeks)? **Yes, the Docusaurus sidebars will directly map to the Modules and Weeks.**
- [x] **III. Simplicity and Maintainability**: Does the plan prioritize standard Docusaurus features and avoid unnecessary complexity? **Yes, prioritizing standard features and avoiding custom CSS/React components.**
- [x] **IV. Interactivity**: Does the plan incorporate interactive elements (code blocks, admonitions) to enhance learning? **Yes, standard Docusaurus/MDX features like code blocks and Admonitions will be used.**
- [x] **V. Performance and Accessibility**: Does the plan account for building a fast, responsive, and accessible site? **Yes, Docusaurus is an SSG framework which inherently meets high performance and accessibility standards.**

### Source Code (repository root)

The Docusaurus site will be initialized in the repository root.

```text
.
├── blog/
├── docs/             # Documentation source files (Modules, Weeks, etc.)
│   ├── modules/
│   ├── weekly-breakdown/
│   └── _category_.json # For structuring sidebars
├── src/              # React components (Minimal usage: primarily for layout and branding)
├── static/           # Static assets (images, logos)
├── docusaurus.config.js # Main Docusaurus configuration (sidebars, theme, plugins)
├── package.json      # Dependencies and scripts (build, start)
└── sidebars.js       # Defines the documentation structure
```

**Structure Decision**: A single-project structure using Docusaurus's default file system layout (`docs/` for content, `docusaurus.config.js` for config) is selected. This adheres to Principle III for simplicity.
