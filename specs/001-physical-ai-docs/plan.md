# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

The project will create a professional documentation website for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" book using Docusaurus. The key focus is on creating an intuitive navigation structure that mirrors the book's content and a visually appealing, modern user interface.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript (Node.js LTS)
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus, React
**Storage**: N/A (Static site)
**Testing**: N/A (Content focus, manual review)
**Target Platform**: Web
**Project Type**: Web Application
**Performance Goals**: Google Lighthouse score > 90 (Performance and Accessibility)
**Constraints**: Must use standard Docusaurus features to align with the constitution's simplicity principle.
**Scale/Scope**: A documentation site encompassing the full content of the provided book.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [X] **I. Content Fidelity**: Does the plan ensure the technical implementation will accurately represent the source educational material?
- [X] **II. Structure Follows Content**: Does the proposed structure map logically to the book's outline (Modules, Weeks)?
- [X] **III. Simplicity and Maintainability**: Does the plan prioritize standard Docusaurus features and avoid unnecessary complexity?
- [X] **IV. Interactivity**: Does the plan incorporate interactive elements (code blocks, admonitions) to enhance learning?
- [X] **V. Performance and Accessibility**: Does the plan account for building a fast, responsive, and accessible site?

**Structure Decision**: A standard Docusaurus project structure will be used. As a static site generator, it operates as a single project and does not require a separate frontend/backend architecture. The main content will reside in the `docs/` directory at the project root, which is the idiomatic approach for Docusaurus.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
