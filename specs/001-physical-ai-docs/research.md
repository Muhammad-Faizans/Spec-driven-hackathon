# Research: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Documentation Site

## Decision: Use Docusaurus for the documentation site.

**Rationale**: Docusaurus is the ideal choice for this project based on the requirements outlined in the feature specification and the principles in the project constitution.

-   **Content-First**: It is specifically designed for building content-heavy websites, which aligns with our primary goal of publishing a book.
-   **Simplicity and Maintainability**: It provides a robust set of features out-of-the-box, allowing us to focus on content without needing complex customizations. This directly supports Principle III.
-   **Interactivity**: It has built-in support for syntax highlighting, admonitions, and other interactive elements that fulfill Principle IV.
-   **Performance and Accessibility**: Docusaurus sites are known to be fast and are built with accessibility in mind, aligning with Principle V.
-   **Structure**: It has a flexible sidebar and navigation system that can easily be configured to match the book's structure of modules and weekly topics, satisfying Principle II.

**Alternatives considered**:

-   **Custom React Site**: This would be a violation of Principle III (Simplicity and Maintainability), as it would require significant development effort for features that Docusaurus provides for free (navigation, search, dark mode, etc.).
-   **Other Static Site Generators (e.g., Hugo, Jekyll)**: While also viable, Docusaurus has a tighter integration with React, which is a common and powerful tool for adding future interactivity if needed. Its focus on documentation sites makes it a more specialized and fitting tool for this specific project.
