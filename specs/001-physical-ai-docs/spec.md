# Feature Specification: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Documentation Site

**Feature Branch**: `1-physical-ai-docs`
**Created**: 2025-12-01
**Status**: Draft

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Intuitive Content Navigation (Priority: P1)

As a student, I want to easily navigate through the course modules and weekly breakdowns so I can follow the curriculum in a structured and logical manner.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality. Without easy navigation, the educational content is difficult to access and follow.

**Independent Test**: A user can be given a specific topic (e.g., "NVIDIA Isaac Sim") and should be able to locate it from the homepage.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** I am on the homepage, **When** I view the main navigation, **Then** I should see clear links to each of the four main course modules.
2.  **Given** I am viewing a module page, **When** I look at the sidebar, **Then** I see a complete, ordered list of topics corresponding to the weekly breakdown for that module.
3.  **Given** I am on a content page, **When** I click the "Next" or "Previous" buttons, **Then** I am taken to the next or previous topic in the curriculum's sequence.

### User Story 2 - Clear Technical Content (Priority: P2)

As a student, I want to view technical details like code blocks and hardware lists in a clean, readable format so I can easily understand and use the information.

**Why this priority**: The content's value is diminished if technical details are presented poorly, leading to errors and frustration.

**Independent Test**: A user can successfully copy a code block and read a hardware table without formatting issues.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** I am viewing a page with source code, **When** I see a code block, **Then** the code is correctly syntax-highlighted and a "Copy" button is present.
2.  **Given** I click the "Copy" button on a code block, **When** I paste the content into an editor, **Then** the code is pasted correctly without extra formatting.
3.  **Given** I am viewing the hardware requirements, **When** I see a list of components, **Then** they are presented in a structured table with clear headings (e.g., "Component", "Model", "Price").

### User Story 3 - Professional and Engaging User Experience (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want the website to have a beautiful, professional, and interactive UI that feels balanced and peaceful, so that my learning experience is engaging and pleasant.

**Why this priority**: A high-quality user interface improves user engagement, reduces distraction, and reflects the professionalism of the content.

**Independent Test**: A new user can browse the site and provide feedback on its visual appeal and ease of use.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** I am on any page, **When** I view the layout, **Then** the colors, fonts, and spacing are consistent and aesthetically pleasing according to the defined style guide.
2.  **Given** I am navigating the site, **When** I hover over links or buttons, **Then** there is subtle, non-intrusive visual feedback (e.g., a change in color or underline).

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

-   **FR-001**: The system MUST display the full, unmodified text content provided for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" course.
-   **FR-002**: The system MUST structure the content into the four primary modules and the corresponding weekly breakdowns.
-   **FR-003**: The system MUST provide a persistent navigation sidebar that shows the user their current position within the overall course structure.
-   **FR-004**: The system MUST render all code snippets with language-appropriate syntax highlighting.
-   **FR-005**: The system MUST provide a one-click copy function for all code snippets.
-   **FR-006**: The user interface MUST be fully responsive and function correctly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
-   **FR-007**: The visual design MUST adhere to a Modern Tech aesthetic, similar to the Docusaurus or Vercel websites, using a cool color palette (blues, dark grays) to feel professional and clean for a technical audience.

### Key Entities

-   **Module**: A top-level section of the course (e.g., "Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System"). It contains a collection of Topics.
-   **Topic**: A specific lesson or subject within a Module, corresponding to the weekly breakdown (e.g., "ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services").
-   **Content Page**: The web page that displays the detailed content (text, images, code) for a specific Topic.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

-   **SC-001**: 95% of users can find a specific topic (e.g., "NVIDIA Isaac Sim") from the homepage in 3 clicks or fewer.
-   **SC-002**: The website will achieve a Google Lighthouse performance score of 90 or higher for both desktop and mobile.
-   **SC-003**: The website will achieve a Google Lighthouse accessibility score of 95 or higher.
-   **SC-004**: In a user survey, at least 80% of participants rate the website's design as "professional" and "easy to use".
