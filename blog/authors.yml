  bio: |
    Muhammad Faizan is a Full Stack Developer and Certified Agentic AI & Robotics Engineer
    with a strong passion for building intelligent, real-world software systems that combine
    modern web technologies with artificial intelligence and robotics.

    He began his journey in software development with frontend engineering, mastering
    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design principles. Over time, he transitioned
    into modern frameworks such as React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, focusing heavily on
    clean UI, professional design systems, and seamless user experiences.

    As his understanding of systems deepened, Faizan moved toward backend development,
    where he specialized in Python-based architectures using FastAPI, PostgreSQL,
    Firebase, and cloud-native patterns. He emphasizes scalable APIs, secure authentication,
    clean database design, and production-ready deployment workflows.

    Faizan’s work later evolved into Agentic AI and Robotics Engineering, where he actively
    explores autonomous agents, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, ROS 2,
    digital twins, and simulation-based development. His focus lies in building systems
    that can reason, plan, and act autonomously while remaining grounded in real-world
    constraints.

    He has developed multiple advanced projects, including AI-powered chatbots,
    RAG-based knowledge systems for books and documentation, full-featured e-commerce
    platforms, and interactive learning tools. His engineering philosophy prioritizes
    long-term maintainability, modular design, and practical usability over short-lived
    prototypes.

    Faizan strongly believes in learning by building and teaching through documentation.
    He structures his projects and content to help beginners grow into advanced engineers,
    especially those aiming to transition into backend, AI, and robotics-focused roles.

    His long-term vision is to contribute to Physical AI — intelligent machines that can
    safely perceive, reason, and interact with the real world — while continuing to build
    high-quality software products that make advanced technology accessible and impactful.
