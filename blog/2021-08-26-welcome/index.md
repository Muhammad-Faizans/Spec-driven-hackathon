Welcome 👋  
This blog is my personal engineering journal—a place where I document what I **build, break, fix, and learn** across **Full Stack Development, Agentic AI, and Robotics**.

I believe the fastest way to learn advanced engineering is **by building real systems**, not just reading theory. Everything you’ll find here is grounded in practical projects, production-style architectures, and lessons learned the hard way.

## What You’ll Find Here

- **Agentic AI Systems**  
  Autonomous agents, reasoning workflows, RAG pipelines, and real-world AI integration.

- **Robotics & ROS 2**  
  Nodes, topics, services, URDF, simulations, digital twins, and AI-to-robot bridges.

- **Backend Engineering**  
  FastAPI, PostgreSQL, authentication, scalable APIs, and clean system design.

- **Frontend & Full Stack Work**  
  Next.js, Tailwind CSS, UI/UX decisions, and end-to-end product development.

- **Learning by Building**  
  Step-by-step project breakdowns designed to help beginners grow into advanced engineers.

## Why This Blog Exists

Most tutorials stop at *“it works”*.  
This blog goes further—focusing on **why things are built a certain way**, how systems evolve, and how web, AI, and robotics intersect in real products.

My long-term goal is to contribute toward **Physical AI**—intelligent systems that can perceive, reason, and safely act in the real world—while sharing everything I learn along the journey.

## How to Use This Blog

- Browse by **tags** to follow a specific topic
- Read chronologically to see how projects evolve
- Treat posts as **building blocks**, not isolated tutorials

If you’re learning backend, AI, robotics, or full stack engineering and want content that’s practical, honest, and system-focused—you’re in the right place.

Let’s build 🚀
