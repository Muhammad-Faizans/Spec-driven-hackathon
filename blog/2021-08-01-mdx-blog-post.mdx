One of the most powerful features of Docusaurus is its support for
[Markdown](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features) **combined with MDX**.
MDX allows you to blend documentation, blogging, and **real interactive components**
in a single post.

This makes it perfect for engineering blogs—especially when explaining systems,
workflows, or concepts that benefit from interaction.

MDX lets you think beyond static text.  
You can **teach by interaction**, not just explanation.

## Why I Use MDX for Technical Writing

Traditional blogs are great for storytelling, but engineering often requires:
- Interactive examples
- Live demos
- Embedded components
- Visual feedback

MDX allows me to bring **frontend engineering practices directly into documentation**
while keeping everything version-controlled and developer-friendly.

## Example: Interactive UI Inside a Blog Post

Below is a simple interactive button written directly inside this blog post using JSX:

```jsx
<button
  onClick={() => alert('You clicked an interactive MDX button!')}
  style={{
    padding: '10px 16px',
    borderRadius: '8px',
    background: '#2563eb',
    color: 'white',
    border: 'none',
    cursor: 'pointer',
    fontWeight: '600',
  }}
>
  Click me
</button>
