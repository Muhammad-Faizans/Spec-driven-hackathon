This is my first post on this blog, and it marks the beginning of a long-term journey
documenting what I build, learn, and experiment with across **Full Stack Development,
Agentic AI, and Robotics Engineering**.

Rather than writing abstract tutorials, this blog focuses on **real systems**—how they
are designed, why certain decisions are made, and what trade-offs exist in practice.

Most of the content here will grow directly out of projects I’m actively working on:
from backend APIs and scalable databases to autonomous agents, RAG systems, and ROS 2–based
robotic workflows.

You can expect posts that include:
- Practical implementations instead of toy examples
- Clear system diagrams and architecture explanations
- Honest discussions about mistakes, limitations, and improvements
- A strong emphasis on learning by building

This blog is not just a knowledge base—it’s a public engineering log.  
If you’re interested in building serious software and intelligent systems, you’re
welcome to follow along.
