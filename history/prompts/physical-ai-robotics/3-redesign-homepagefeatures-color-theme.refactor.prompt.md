## Prompt

@src/components/HomepageFeatures/index.tsx redesign this section according to the new color theme make it corect beautiful and professional balanced that looking like a wowwwwwww

## Response snapshot

I have updated `src/components/HomepageFeatures/index.tsx` to apply the new `featureCard` class, integrating the new color theme and styling into your Docusaurus homepage features.

The `HomepageFeatures` section should now have:
*   An off-white background (`#F5F5DC`).
*   Individual feature cards with a white background (`#FFFFFF`), subtle shadows, and internal padding.
*   Feature headings in a professional blue (`#007BFF`).
*   Improved spacing and visual balance.

Remember that for the ultimate "wow" effect, you still need to replace the placeholder SVGs with thematic images.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The HomepageFeatures component was redesigned with the specified blue, white, and off-white color theme, improving its aesthetic and professionalism.
- 🧪 Tests: n/a
- 📁 Files: 2 files modified.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user should still replace the placeholder SVGs for optimal visual appeal.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully applied the color theme and styling. It would be beneficial to have a tool to suggest or generate SVG placeholders based on text descriptions to fully complete such UI tasks.
