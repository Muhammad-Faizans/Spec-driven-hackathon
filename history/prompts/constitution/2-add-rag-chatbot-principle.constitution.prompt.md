## Prompt

/sp.constitution what you have to do now add the consistitiution that we have to implement the chatbot in this project according to these requirements 2. Integrated RAG Chatbot Development: Build and embed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot within the published book. This chatbot, utilizing the OpenAI Agents/ChatKit SDKs, FastAPI, Neon Serverless Postgres database, and Qdrant Cloud Free Tier, must be able to answer user questions about the book's content, including answering questions based only on text selected by the user.

## Response snapshot

I have updated the plan template to reflect the new chatbot requirement. The constitution and relevant templates are now fully in sync.

Here is a summary of the changes:

*   **Constitution Amended**: The constitution is now at version **1.1.0**. It includes a new principle (VI) requiring the implementation of an integrated RAG chatbot.
*   **Plan Template Updated**: The project's planning template now includes a checklist item to ensure all future development plans account for this new chatbot requirement.

Here is a suggested commit message:

```
