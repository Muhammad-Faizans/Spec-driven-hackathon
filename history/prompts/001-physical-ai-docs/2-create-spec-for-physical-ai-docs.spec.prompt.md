## Prompt

/sp.specify now we have to create the specifications of this project like we have to write the book on physical ai and humanized robots so make me the specifications and also keep in mind i want a very beautiful and professional ui that will be balanced peacful but look very intactive

## Response snapshot

The feature specification for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Documentation Site" is now complete and validated.

-   **Branch**: `1-physical-ai-docs`
-   **Specification**: `specs/001-physical-ai-docs/spec.md`
-   **Checklist**: All quality checks have passed.

The project is ready for the next phase. You can now proceed with the `/sp.plan` command to create an implementation plan.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The feature specification was successfully created and clarified with the user.
- 🧪 Tests: n/a
- 📁 Files: 2 files created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: The script for creating PHRs failed again. I need to be prepared for this and have a solid manual fallback process.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Script execution failed.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): n/a
- Prompt variant (if applicable): n/a
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): n/a
