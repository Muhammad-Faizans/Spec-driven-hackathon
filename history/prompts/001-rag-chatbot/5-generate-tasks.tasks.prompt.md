## Prompt

/sp.tasks now move towrds the tasks

## Response snapshot

I have generated the `tasks.md` file.

**Summary**:
*   **Total Tasks**: 30
*   **User Story 1 Tasks**: 8
*   **User Story 2 Tasks**: 5
*   **MVP Scope**: The 8 tasks in User Story 1, plus the foundational and setup tasks, constitute the MVP.
*   **Independent Test Criteria**: Each user story has clear, independent test criteria, allowing for incremental development and validation.

The project is now fully planned and broken down into actionable tasks. The `tasks.md` file is located at `specs/001-rag-chatbot/tasks.md`.
