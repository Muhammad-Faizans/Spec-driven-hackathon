## Prompt

/sp.specify now move towards the specfification of chatbot

## Response snapshot

I have created the specification and a completed quality checklist. The specification for the RAG chatbot is now ready for the planning phase.

To summarize:

*   **Specification**: `specs/001-rag-chatbot/spec.md`

You can now proceed with `/sp.plan`.
