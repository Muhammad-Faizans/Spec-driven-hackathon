/sp.analyze now analyze all the things that all the things are correct ??

## Response snapshot

I have loaded all the necessary documents. Now, I will perform the analysis and generate the report.

## Specification Analysis Report

| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A1** | **Underspecification** | **LOW** | `specs/001-rag-chatbot/tasks.md` | The task `T029` to create `README.md` files is good, but the plan doesn't specify what should be in them. | Add a brief outline of the expected README content in the plan or a separate document. |
| **A2** | **Inconsistency** | **LOW** | `specs/001-rag-chatbot/quickstart.md` | The `quickstart.md` mentions running migrations with `alembic`, but Alembic is not listed as a dependency in the `plan.md`. | Add Alembic to the list of dependencies in `plan.md`. |
| **A3** | **Underspecification** | **MEDIUM** | `specs/001-rag-chatbot/tasks.md` | The task `T026` for error handling is vague. It doesn't specify what kinds of errors to handle or what the expected behavior should be. | The `spec.md` should be updated to include more specific error handling requirements (e.g., for API timeouts, invalid user input, etc.). |

**Coverage Summary Table:**

| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `provide-chat-interface` | ✅ | T018, T019 | Fully covered. |
| `answer-general-questions`| ✅ | T013-T017, T020 | Fully covered. |
| `answer-selected-text` | ✅ | T021-T025 | Fully covered. |
| `exclusive-answers` | ✅ | T022 | Covered by the implementation of the selected-text endpoint. |
| `inform-no-answer` | ✅ | Acceptance criteria in `spec.md` implies this, but no explicit task. | A specific task should be added to handle this case. |
| `decline-off-topic` | ✅ | Acceptance criteria in `spec.md` implies this, but no explicit task. | A specific task should be added to handle this case. |

**Constitution Alignment Issues:**

None found. The `plan.md` includes a thorough constitution check, and the artifacts align with it.

**Unmapped Tasks:**

None found. All tasks are mapped to a specific phase and contribute to the user stories.

**Metrics:**

*   **Total Requirements**: 6
*   **Total Tasks**: 30
*   **Coverage %**: 66% (4 of 6 requirements have explicit tasks)
*   **Ambiguity Count**: 0
*   **Duplication Count**: 0
*   **Critical Issues Count**: 0

### Next Actions

The analysis reveals a few minor underspecified areas, particularly around error handling and negative test cases. While there are no critical blockers, I recommend addressing these before starting implementation to ensure a more robust final product.

*   **Recommended**: Run `/sp.specify` to add more detailed requirements for error handling and for when the chatbot cannot find an answer. Then, run `/sp.tasks` to add tasks for these new requirements.
*   **Optional**: Manually edit `plan.md` to add `alembic` to the dependencies and `tasks.md` to add more detail to the README task.

Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top 3 issues?

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The cross-artifact analysis was performed, and a report was generated.
- 🧪 Tests: n/a
- 📁 Files: 1 PHR file created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Depends on user response to remediation offer.
- 🧠 Reflection: The analysis identified minor areas for improvement, which is the intended outcome of this step. The process was smooth.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
