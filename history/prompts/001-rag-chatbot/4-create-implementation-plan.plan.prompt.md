## Prompt

/sp.plan now move towrds the plan

## Response snapshot

The implementation plan is now complete. I have created all the necessary design artifacts, and the agent's context has been updated.

Here is a summary of the generated artifacts:
*   **Implementation Plan**: `specs/001-rag-chatbot/plan.md`
*   **Research**: `specs/001-rag-chatbot/research.md`
*   **Data Model**: `specs/001-rag-chatbot/data-model.md`
*   **API Contract**: `specs/001-rag-chatbot/contracts/openapi.yaml`
*   **Quickstart Guide**: `specs/001-rag-chatbot/quickstart.md`

The project is now ready for the task generation phase. You can proceed with `/sp.tasks`.

## Outcome
