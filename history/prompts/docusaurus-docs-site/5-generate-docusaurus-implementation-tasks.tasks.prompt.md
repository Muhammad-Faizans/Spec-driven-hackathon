## Prompt

/sp.tasks ok now make the tasks

## Response snapshot

The task list is complete and saved at `specs/001-docusaurus-docs-site/tasks.md`.

Summary of Tasks:
*   Total Tasks: 20
*   MVP Scope: All tasks (The entire documentation site)
*   Next Step: Begin implementation by running the first task.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: A detailed, dependency-ordered task list was created, aligning with the project plan and constitution.
- 🧪 Tests: n/a
- 📁 Files: 1 new file created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user is expected to run `/sp.implement` or ask to execute the first task.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully recovered from the directory inconsistency by copying files before task generation. The task list is now ready for implementation.

- Failure modes observed: n/a
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): n/a
- Prompt variant (if applicable): n/a
