## Prompt

/sp.specify go towrds see the consitituion file again generate the again specifications

## Response snapshot

The specification process is now complete.

- **New Branch**: `001-docusaurus-docs-site` (checked out)
- **Specification Path**: `specs/001-docusaurus-docs-site/spec.md`
- **Checklist**: All items passed and saved to `specs/001-docusaurus-docs-site/checklists/requirements.md`.

The feature is ready to be broken down into development tasks.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: A formal, quality-checked feature specification was created under the new feature directory and branch (`001-docusaurus-docs-site`), ensuring all requirements are clearly defined and testable.
- 🧪 Tests: n/a
- 📁 Files: 2 new files created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user is expected to run `/sp.tasks` next.
- 🧠 Reflection: The re-run of `/sp.specify` was handled by creating a new, numbered feature directory as mandated by the command's outline, and the spec content was accurately derived from the project context.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Script execution failed, manual creation of spec and checklist performed.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): n/a
- Prompt variant (if applicable): n/a
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): n/a
