## Prompt

/sp.plan now move towards this

## Response snapshot

I have now completed Phase 0 and Phase 1 of the planning workflow by generating all required design artifacts for the Docusaurus site:

*   `spec.md`
*   `research.md`
*   `data-model.md`
*   `quickstart.md`
*   `contracts/api-contracts.md`

The plan is now complete and all architectural decisions have been documented.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: All necessary design artifacts for the static Docusaurus site were generated and documented, completing the planning phase (Phase 0/1).
- 🧪 Tests: n/a
- 📁 Files: 5 new files created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user is expected to run `/sp.tasks` next.
- 🧠 Reflection: The planning phase was streamlined due to the simplicity of the SSG project, allowing for rapid generation of the artifacts with N/A rationales for traditional backend components.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: n/a
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): n/a
- Prompt variant (if applicable): n/a
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): n/a
