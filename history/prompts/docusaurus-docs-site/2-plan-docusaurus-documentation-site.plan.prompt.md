## Prompt

please proceed with the sp.planplease proceed with the /sp.plan

## Response snapshot

The implementation plan has been written to specs/docusaurus-docs-site/plan.md.

Here is a summary of the plan:

*   Goal: Create a Docusaurus-based documentation site for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" content.
*   Structure: The Docusaurus sidebars will be configured to directly reflect the book's Modules (1-4) and the Weekly Breakdown (Weeks 1-13), adhering to Constitution Principle II (Structure Follows Content).
*   Technology: Docusaurus v3+ (SSG), minimal custom components, in line with Principle III (Simplicity and Maintainability).
*   Next Step: The next logical step is to break this plan down into actionable, testable tasks using the /sp.tasks command.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: A detailed implementation plan for the Docusaurus site was created, ensuring alignment with the project constitution.
- 🧪 Tests: n/a
- 📁 Files: 1 file created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user is expected to run `/sp.tasks` next.
- 🧠 Reflection: The planning phase successfully translated the user's high-level content into a concrete, technically sound, and constitution-compliant architectural approach for the Docusaurus site.
