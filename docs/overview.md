# Learning Outcomes and Course Overview

This section outlines the overarching goals and expected competencies students will achieve by the end of the course.

## Why Physical AI Matters

Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments. This represents a significant transition from AI models confined to digital environments to **embodied intelligence** that operates in physical space.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

*   Understand Physical AI principles and embodied intelligence.
*   Master ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) for robotic control.
*   Simulate robots with Gazebo and Unity.
*   Develop with the NVIDIA Isaac AI robot platform.
*   Design humanoid robots for natural interactions.
*   Integrate GPT models for conversational robotics.
